# Full Stack Open Progress â€“ Sections 0â€“3

This repository contains my solutions and code samples as I work through the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by the University of Helsinki. The course covers modern web development with JavaScript, focusing on React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## ðŸŒ± Course Progress

### âœ… Completed Sections
- **Section 0:** Fundamentals of Web Apps
- **Section 1:** Introduction to React
- **Section 2:** Communicating with Server
- **Section 3:** Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express

### ðŸ”œ Upcoming
- **Section 4:** Testing Express servers, user administration
- **Section 5 and beyond:** Frontend design, user authentication, GraphQL, TypeScript, CI/CD, and more

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings So Far
- Built React components using hooks and state
- Managed data fetching and updating with Axios and RESTful APIs
- Built a basic backend using Node.js and Express
- Structured an API with multiple routes and middleware
- Implemented CRUD operations for a phonebook app using an in-memory and JSON-based database

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then:

```bash
cd part3/phonebook-backend  # Example path
npm install
npm run dev
```

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
